# Dans-Album-Matrix
compiling info for Raspberry Pi 0 W to 64 x 64 album art Matrix Panel

Mostly pulling from the following GIT:
https://github.com/kylejohnsonkj/rpi-spotify-matrix-display?tab=readme-ov-file

FIRST we will need to set up the pi, they link the wiki in the GIT above, but essentially put an SD card into your PC, download the imager from here:
https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/

and flash the SD to whatever the recommended is (i believe 32bit standard) for a 0 W pi. This comes with a desktop environment, for this project you COULD go headless but the GUI will let us see the pixel art on screen before rendering to the matrix, which could be nice if we hit a snag on the matrix panel specifically.

I believe you have the power supply I got you, is that true, or did i accidentally bring it home with me? Also, while we should be able to SSH into the pi 0 W, an HDMI to HDMI mini may be helpful if we have issues. See below for links:

Pi 0 W Just takes 5V 1.2A, you can prolly find that around but if not: https://tinyurl.com/yc4e8ncc
